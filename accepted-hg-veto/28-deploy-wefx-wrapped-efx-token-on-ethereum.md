This proposal was Accepted by the DAO community but vetoed by the High Guard. 

Their comment was:

> This proposal was rejected by a resolution of the High Guard. It was identified to be in conflict with other developments in the network. The author will revisit this proposal with the given feedback.

It is unclear if the author ever revisited this proposal as was intended to establish a bridge to Ethereum, but it would later be revealed that the Foundation decided to create a bridge to Binance Smart Chain.
