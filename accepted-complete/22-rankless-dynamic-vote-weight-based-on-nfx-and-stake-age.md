# \#22: Rankless Dynamic Vote Weight Based on NFX and Stake Age \(C4\)

{% embed url="https://dao.effect.network/proposals/22" %}

This proposal was a technical proposal that requested the Foundation abolish ranks for calculating vote weight and instead replace it with with a dynamic rankless system. The Foundation was receptive to this idea and published a more technical proposal with another vote to confirm the change to this new system. This proposal will be considered completed once that change is completed.

This P43 has both passed and has been implemented on June 4th, 2021. Thus both P22 and P43 can be considered complete.
