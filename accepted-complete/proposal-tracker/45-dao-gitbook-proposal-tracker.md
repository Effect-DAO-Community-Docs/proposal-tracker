# #45: DAO GitBook Proposal Tracker (C12)

{% embed url="https://dao.effect.network/proposals/45" %}

This proposal is an invoice for work spent writing out the content of the proposal tracker as of C11 and for further updates made in C12. It is also an endorsement of the "proposal tracker" position for which DAO members can nominate themselves and request EFX compensation for the engagement of duties necessary for the position. It can be considered complete after the end of C12.
