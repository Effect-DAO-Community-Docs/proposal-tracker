{% embed url="https://dao.effect.network/proposals/7" %}

At the time of this proposal, the Foundation had 200 million EFX tokens locked on NEO. While this proposal was Accepted with a majority "Yes" vote, the burning of these 200 million EFX was considered out of scope and was not executed. These EFX tokens were eventually moved to the EOS account [https://www.bloks.io/account/efx](https://www.bloks.io/account/efx). Later, 100 million EFX were moved from that account to the EOS account [https://www.bloks.io/account/bsc.efx](https://www.bloks.io/account/bsc.efx) which in the Token Map is designated as funds for "Liquidity & Partnerships".
