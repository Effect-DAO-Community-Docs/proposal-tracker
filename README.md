# Proposal Tracker

Since the formation of the DAO a substantial number of DAO Proposals have passed. The purpose of this space is to provide a place for all DAO members to monitor the progress of proposals they have voted on. This space will focus on Active, Accepted and Rejected proposals. 

If you are the author of a proposal and would like your proposal page updated check who is the current proposal tracker on the contact page and send them a message on discord.

This tracker is not intended to provide an in depth analysis of each proposal, if you are interested in further information about a proposal it is highly recommended to read the full proposal available on the Effect DAO Dashboard and also discuss it with the author on the community discord server.
