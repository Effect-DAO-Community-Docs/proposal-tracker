# \#35: High Guard Resolution \#1: Phishing hack interception \(C6\)

{% embed url="https://dao.effect.network/proposals/35" %}

It was discovered a DAO member fell for a phishing attack and the hacker was about to receive the stolen funds after initiating unstaking for all EFX and NFX tokens. The High Guard made an unprecedented decision to request the funds be intercepted by the Foundation. The Foundation agreed with the action and the funds were intercepted before they could be delivered to the compromised account. 

This proposal is considered complete, but due to it's exceptional case will be classified as such.
