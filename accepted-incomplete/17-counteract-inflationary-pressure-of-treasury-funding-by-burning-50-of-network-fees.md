# \#17: Counteract Inflationary Pressure of Treasury Funding By Burning 50% Of Network Fees \(C3\)

{% embed url="https://dao.effect.network/proposals/17" %}

This proposal is an endorsement for the Foundation establishing a toggleable burn mechanism for the DAO to enable or disable through proposal vote. As of May 26th, 2021 the Network Fee has not been programmatically implemented. The Foundation has not rejected outright the DAO endorsement of a toggleable burn mechanism so this proposal will be considered incomplete until they implement it or publish a more technical proposal to implement it.
