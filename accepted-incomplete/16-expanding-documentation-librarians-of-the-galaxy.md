# #16: Expanding Documentation: Librarians Of The Galaxy (C3)

THIS PROPOSAL IS IN PROGRESS. THIS COMMUNITY MANAGED GITBOOK IS PART OF THIS PROGRESS.

{% embed url="https://dao.effect.network/proposals/16" %}

This proposal was an endorsement for the creation of expansive documentation for the Effect Network platform. The proposal itself was structured as an "endorsement" so it can be technically considered complete, however, the Foundation has signaled that it is receptive to this endorsement and has put the creation of a developer SDK on it's roadmap. This proposal will be considered incomplete until that SDK is released.
