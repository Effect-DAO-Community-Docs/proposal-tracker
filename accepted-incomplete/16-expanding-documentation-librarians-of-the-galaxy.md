# \#16: Expanding Documentation: Librarians Of The Galaxy \(C3\)

{% embed url="https://dao.effect.network/proposals/16" %}

This proposal was an endorsement for the creation of documentation for the Effect Network platform. The proposal itself was structured as an "endorsement" so it can be technically considered complete, however, the Foundation has signaled that it is receptive to this endorsement and has put the creation of a developer SDK on it's roadmap. This proposal will be considered incomplete until that SDK is released.
