# #29: "Worker of the Week" Page on DAO Dashboard (C6)

{% embed url="https://dao.effect.network/proposals/29" %}

This proposal was a request for a modification to the Dashboard to include a component displaying "Worker of the Week". The author stated intent to communicate with Jesse or Laurens to establish a budget an a more technical proposal. Until a "Worker of the Week" page is available or that technical proposal is published this proposal will be considered incomplete.



Worker of the week has stopped being a thing, so the Foundation stated their disinterest in having such a page on the dashboard.
